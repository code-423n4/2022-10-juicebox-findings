#### Event is missing indexed fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

16-22:
  event TierDelegateVotesChanged(
    address indexed delegate,
    uint256 indexed tierId,
    uint256 previousBalance,
    uint256 newBalance,
    address callre
  );

// contracts/interfaces/IJBTiered721Delegate.sol
29:   event AddTier(uint256 indexed tierId, JB721TierParams data, address caller);

// contracts/interfaces/IJBTiered721DelegateDeployer.sol
9-13:
  event DelegateDeployed(
    uint256 indexed projectId,
    IJBTiered721Delegate newDelegate,
    JB721GovernanceType governanceType
  );
``` 

#### require()/revert() statements should have descriptive reason strings

```solidity
// contracts/JBTiered721Delegate.sol
216:    require(address(this) != codeOrigin);
218:    require(address(store) == address(0));
```


#### Use `encode` instead of `encodePacked` for hashing

Use of `abi.encodePacked` is safe, but unnecessary and not recommended. `abi.encodePacked` can result in hash collisions when used with two dynamic arguments (string/bytes).

There is also discussion of removing `abi.encodePacked` from future versions of Solidity (ethereum/solidity#11593), so using `abi.encode` now will ensure compatibility in the future.

Instances number of this issue: 
```solidity
// contracts/libraries/JBIpfsDecoder.sol
28:     bytes memory completeHexString = abi.encodePacked(bytes2(0x1220), _hexString);
34:     return string(abi.encodePacked(_baseUri, ipfsHash));
```
