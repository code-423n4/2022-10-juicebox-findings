## Function Calls in Loop Could Lead to Denial of Service
Function calls made in unbounded loop are error-prone with potential resource exhaustion as it can trap the contract due to the gas limitations or failed transactions. Here are some of the instances entailed:

https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JB721TieredGovernance.sol#L158
https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/abstract/JB721Delegate.sol#L272

Consider bounding the loop where possible to avoid unnecessary gas wastage and denial of service.

## Lines Too Long
Lines in source code are typically limited to 80 characters, but itâ€™s reasonable to stretch beyond this limit when need be as monitor screens theses days are comparatively larger. Considering the files will most likely reside in GitHub that will have a scroll bar automatically kick in when the length is over 164 characters, all code lines and comments should be split when/before hitting this length. Keep line width to max 120 characters for better readability where possible. Here are some of the instances entailed:

https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/abstract/JB721Delegate.sol#L242
https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JBTiered721Delegate.sol#L198

## Use `delete` to Clear Variables
`delete a` assigns the initial value for the type to `a`. i.e. for integers it is equivalent to `a = 0`, but it can also be used on arrays, where it assigns a dynamic array of length zero or a static array of the same length with all elements reset. For structs, it assigns a struct with all members reset. Similarly, it can also be used to set an address to zero address. It has no effect on whole mappings though (as the keys of mappings may be arbitrary and are generally unknown). However, individual keys and what they map to can be deleted: If `a` is a mapping, then `delete a[x]` will delete the value stored at x.

The delete key better conveys the intention and is also more idiomatic. Consider replacing assignments of zero with delete statements. Here is one of the instances entailed:

https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JBTiered721DelegateStore.sol#L1198

## `block.timestamp` Unreliable
The use of `block.timestamp` as part of the time checks can be slightly altered by miners/validators to favor them in contracts that have logic strongly dependent on them.

Consider taking into account this issue and warning the users that such a scenario could happen. If the alteration of timestamps cannot affect the protocol in any way, consider documenting the reasoning and writing tests enforcing that these guarantees will be preserved even if the code changes in the future.

Here is one of the instances entailed:

https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JBTiered721DelegateStore.sol#L903

## Events Associated With Setter Functions
Consider having events associated with setter functions emit both the new and old values instead of just the new value. Here are some of the few instances entailed:

https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JBTiered721Delegate.sol#L370-L423

## Sanity Checks
Zero address checks should be implemented at the constructor to avoid accidental error(s) that could result in non-functional calls associated with it or in the worst scenario a redeployment of contract when it concerns an immutable variable. For instance, the following code block may be rewritten as:

https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JBTiered721DelegateProjectDeployer.sol#L47-L54

```
  constructor(
    IJBController _controller,
    IJBTiered721DelegateDeployer _delegateDeployer,
    IJBOperatorStore _operatorStore
  ) JBOperatable(_operatorStore) {
    if (address(_controller) == address(0) || address(_delegateDeployer) == address(0) || address(_operatorStore) == address(0))
        revert ADDRESS_ZERO();
    controller = _controller;
    delegateDeployer = _delegateDeployer;
  }
```
Note: The custom error may have to be added at the top of the contract.

## Missing Require Error Message
Consider adding a less than 32 character string message to all require statements just so that a relevant message would be displayed in the event of a revert. Here are some of the instances entailed:

https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JBTiered721Delegate.sol#L216-L218

## Add a Timelock to Critical Parameter Change
It is a good practice to give time for users to react and adjust to critical changes with a mandatory time window between them. The first step merely broadcasts to users that a particular change is coming, and the second step commits that change after a suitable waiting period. This allows users that do not accept the change to withdraw within the grace period. A timelock provides more guarantees and reduces the level of trust required, thus decreasing risk for users. It also indicates that the project is legitimate (less risk of a malicious Owner making any malicious or ulterior intention). Specifically, privileged roles could use front running to make malicious changes just ahead of incoming transactions, or purely accidental negative effects could occur due to the unfortunate timing of changes. Here are some of the instances entailed:

https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JBTiered721Delegate.sol#L370-L423

## Contract Owner Has Too Many Privileges
The owner of the contracts has too many privileges relative to standard users. The consequence is disastrous if the contract owner's private key has been compromised. And, in the event the key was lost or unrecoverable, no implementation upgrades and system parameter updates will ever be possible.

For a Juicebox Project project this grand, it increases the likelihood that the owner will be targeted by an attacker, especially given the insufficient protection on sensitive owner private keys. The concentration of privileges creates a single point of failure; and, here are some of the incidents that could possibly transpire:

1. Change new owner by invoking `_transferOwnership()` to hijack the entire protocol.
2. Mess up with critical state variables, e.g. `beneficiary`, `baseUri`, `contractUri`, `tokenUriResolver` etc.

Consider:
1) splitting privileges (e.g. via the multisig option) to ensure that no one address has excessive ownership of the system,
2) clearly documenting the functions and implementations the owner can change,
3) documenting the risks associated with privileged users and single points of failure, and
4) ensuring that users are aware of all the risks associated with the system.
