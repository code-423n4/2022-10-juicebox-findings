delete *_tokenId* as it has never needed

One suggestion is to use custom error Revert to process exception in most write transactions

It appears the function just data transformation between JBStored721Tier and JB721Tier and wasted much computation. 
These two concepts should be unified into one to avoid such unnecessary transformation

JBStored721Tier and JB721Tier should also be unified to avoid unnecessary data transformation

Suggest to change function *setTierDelegate* to external if it will not be called by the contract itself

https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JB721TieredGovernance.sol#L44-L53
Consider combing the two mappings into one mapping from address->uint256->struct

use custom error revert instead of *require* without an error msg

https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/abstract/JB721Delegate.sol#L5
projectId and directly can be changed to immutable if it will be assigned once by the *_initialize* function.
