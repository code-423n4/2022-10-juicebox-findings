## [L-01] Missing zero address for constructor
## Code Snipped
https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JBTiered721DelegateDeployer.sol#L46-L49
## Recommendation
Checking addresses against zero-address during initialization in constructor is a security best-practice. However, such checks are missing in multiple constructors.â€¨ Allowing zero-addresses will lead to contract reverts and force redeployments if there are no setters for such address variables. So we recommend to Add zero-address checks in the constructors.

## [L-02] Address nft cant be zero
## Code Snipped
https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JBTiered721DelegateStore.sol#L214
## Recommendation
to avoid zero address in nft. we suggest to add zero check adrress to the function.

## [N-01] Natspec Incomplete
## Code Snipped
https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/blob/f9893b1497098241dd3a664956d8016ff0d0efd0/contracts/JBTiered721DelegateDeployer.sol#L115
## Recommendation
the file has a natspec comment  to explain utility about function or parameter. but in these file the natspec comment incomplete. So we recommend to complete the natspec comment to increase readability and make it easier when there is an audit.
