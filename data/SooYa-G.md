## calldata
When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. Each iteration of this loop costs at least 60 gas (i.e. `60*<mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution.
If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, its still more efficient to use `calldata` when the external function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called.

## Wrong use of the `memory` keyword for a struct
When copying a state struct in memory, there are as many SLOADs and MSTOREs as there are slots. When reading the whole struct multiple times is not needed, itâ€™s better to actually only read the relevant field(s). When only some of the fields are read several times, these particular values should be cached instead of the whole state struct.
