## 1. `Pragma` not fixed
Contracts should be deployed using the same compiler version/flags with which they have been tested.

## 2. `^0.8.16`, an unstable Compiler Version used.
`^0.8.16` is a pretty new and unstable compiler version. Use a Stable compiler version like `0.8.7`, `0.8.8`, or `0.8.9` instead.
